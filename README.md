#HelathCare Services Assignment

In this project, I developed a web application using React for the frontend and Tailwind CSS for styling, with Redux Toolkit employed for state management. The application features a user-friendly interface that allows users to add, delete, and update services easily.

To enhance user experience, I implemented validation to ensure that all service information—specifically name, description, and price—is filled out correctly. The application enforces rules such that the service name and description cannot be empty, and the price must be a numeric value.

Additionally, I utilized local storage to persistently store the services. This means that even after refreshing the page, the added services remain available, providing a seamless experience for users. also the website is responsive

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
